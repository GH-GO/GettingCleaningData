CodeBook for the final project in Getting and Cleaning Data 
The run_analysis.R script is created according to the instructions in Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project. The project is composed by 5 steps.
1.	Download step 
o	Download and extract data in the “UCI HAR Dataset” folder

2.	Assign data to variables step
o	features <- features.txt : 561 rows, 2 columns 
3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ from the accelerometer and gyroscope.
o	activities <- activity_labels.txt : 6 rows, 2 columns 
Codes and descriptions of 6 typical activities
o	subject_test <- test/subject_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 column 
test data of test subjects
o	x_test <- test/X_test.txt : 2947 rows, 561 columns 
recorded features test data
o	y_test <- test/y_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 columns 
test data of activities
o	subject_train <- test/subject_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 column 
train data of subjects under observation
o	x_train <- test/X_train.txt : 7352 rows, 561 columns 
train data features 
o	y_train <- test/y_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 columns 
activities’ code train data

3.	Merging training and test sets to create a single data set 
o	Merge x_train and x_test using rbind() function to obtain X (10299 rows, 561 columns)
o	Merge y_train and y_test using rbind() function to obtain Y (10299 rows, 1 column) 
o	Merge subject_train and subject_test using rbind() function to obtain Subject (10299 rows, 1 column) 
o	AllData (10299 rows, 563 column) is created by merging Subject, Y and X using cbind() function

4.	Extracting only mean and standard deviation for each measurement 
o	Select from AllData, only columns: subject, code and mean and standard deviation (std) to obtain AllDataMeanStd (10299 rows, 88 columns) 

5.	Using descriptive activity names to rename activities in the dataframe 
o	Replace codes in the data-frame AllDataMeanStd, column code with corresponding labels available in the second column of activities data-frame

6.	Labelling the data set with descriptive variable names 
o	The name of the columns belonging to the data-frame AllDataMeanStd are renamed as follows
•	code renamed as Activities
•	All Acc renamed as Accelerometer
•	All Gyro renamed as Gyroscope
•	All BodyBody renamed as Body
•	All Mag renamed as Magnitude
•	All strings starting with character f renamed as Frequency
•	All strings starting with character t renamed as Time
The final data-frame is then called TidyDf1
7.	Creating a new data set from the previous one with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject 
o	Group in a temporary data-frame called SumAllDataMeanStdTemp the data by Subject and Activity
o	Compute the means of each variable for each activity and each subject and store them in data-frame SumAllDataMeanStd (180 rows, 88 columns)
The final data-frame is then called TidyDf2
8.	Exporting/writing data into a txt file
o	Export TidyDf2into FinalData.txt file with the function write.table
